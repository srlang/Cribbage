This is a set of simple scripts that I am using to develop a scorer for a Cribbage game. The point of making the scorer was to either prove or disprove the existence of a 19-hand.

It is an old family joke that a 19-hand doesn't exist. It came to me one night when I could not sleep that I could solve this problem using J in a fairly simple way, rather than just looking it up on the internet. To clarify, by "old family joke," I mean "something my grandmother said once and others backed up."
