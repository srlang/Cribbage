chooser:
    - slight misnomer and may very well be removed 
    - Functions and headers to interact with user and choose the optimal
        hand.
    - nothing seems too polished or tested, so it'll probably be rewritten 
        later and probably renamed too.

enumerate:
    - multi-threaded enumerator
    - simply displays all possible cribbage hands with console output.
    - not really helpful
    - good for semaphore and pthread refresher, though

scorer:
    - actual scoring functions to score a hand of cribbage
    - function of note: 
        score_t score(hand_t *hand)
            returns a score for a given hand pointed to 

main:
    - load of junk poorly thought up and thrown together to make a UI
    - should be stripped to what was said in the TODO file
