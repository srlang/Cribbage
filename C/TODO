Main method should be rewritten so that it just calls a single function
    with the hand's cards, a number of threads allowed to be created to help
    the calculation and returns the arrangement with the greatest possibility 
    of getting the highest points (what the J script already does)
    
    Main function itself will just do some basic I/O operations now
    Will eventually extend to allow a full game to be played with an opponent.
        (hopefully; if I get around to it)
