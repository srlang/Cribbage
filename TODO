C/:
    - enumerator keeps popping up with 255's randomly at the 
        k-level loop

Meta:
    - Perhaps make a meta-agent that decides when to begin
        looking for pegging hands or trying to be defensive.
    Plan:
        - Chooser that, knowing who gets the crib, will weigh
            the pros and cons of throwing the cards in with
            the pros and cons of keeping the other cards.
                - Will require a weighted function to evaluate
                    how defensive to play
        - Agent to keep track of whose turn it is and feed that
            to the above chooser function
        - Evaluator to determine what I think a good pegging hand 
            will look like 
                - favor cards and combos I like for pegging
        - Implement a learner to actually do the pegging
        - See which hands tend to peg better and use that as the 
            new pegging evaluator
                - only use in situations that pegging is wanted


At some point, I would like to translate what I have into a C 
    implementation. That way, I can take advantage of multiple 
    threads and lower-level implementation.

    - Figure out a better(?) method to evaluate the hands.
